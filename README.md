Mechanical Engineer | Enthusiastic about Technology

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mateus, a Mechanical Engineer with a strong passion for technology. I'm constantly studying Software Engineering to enhance my problem-solving skills and find innovative solutions to the challenges I encounter in my daily life.

ðŸ”­ Current project: STD Test Generator [Python/PyQt5], an application aimed at improving a manual process by leveraging Excel files and folder structure manipulation. The goal is to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of creating, copying, reading, and editing Excel files, which are enhanced with VBA and macros to send data to a database. By automating these tasks, the STD Test Generator ensures a precise and standardized approach to test file management and folder structure creation. It simplifies the process of keeping the database updated and maintains a consistent and organized tree-like structure for test files and folders. Through this solution, I strive to streamline the workflow, eliminate manual errors, and save valuable time for stakeholders involved in the testing process. The STD Test Generator contributes to improved efficiency, data integrity and overall quality assurance.

ðŸŒ± Currently learning Python, VBA and Databases.

ðŸ“š Currently studying Software Engineering at FIAP.
